On this premier episode of the Sacristy, Fathers Matt and David look forward to the Tenth Sunday of Pentecost, August 18, 2019. You'll hear one of our Pop-Culture Confessions, explore the Church Calendar for the week, and explore some of the unique aspects of the liturgy and how they can be useful for formation and evangelism. 

As always, we'll close with our Sermon First Pass with the Sunday lessons from X Pentecost:\
\
Year C, Track II\
Jeremiah 23:23-29 \
Psalm 82;\
Hebrews 11:29-12:2\
Luke 12:49-56

We hope you've been encouraged and edified by our work! Christ be with you!
