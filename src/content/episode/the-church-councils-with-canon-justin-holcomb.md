On this fourth episode of the Sacristy, Fathers Matt and David prepare for the Fifteenth Sunday after Pentecost, September 22, 2019. This week, they welcome Canon Justin Holcomb as the Sacristy’s first guest! You hear him put up with stories of former lives in music before beginning an incredible survey of the first seven Councils of the Church. 

As always, we'll close with our Sermon First Pass with the Sunday lessons from XV Pentecost:\
**Year C, Track II, Proper 20**\
Amos 8:4-7\
Psalm 113\
1 Timothy 2:1-7\
Luke 16:1-13

We hope you've been encouraged and edified by our work! Christ be with you!
