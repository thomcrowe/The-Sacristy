On this fifth episode of the Sacristy, Fathers Matt and David prepare for the Seventeenth Sunday after Pentecost, October 6, 2019. And so, Fr. Matt and Fr. David celebrate their 1000th listen with a game. This week, theyâ€™ll discuss that basic habit of Christian devotion, the sign of the cross. As always, we'll close with our Sermon First Pass with the Sunday lessons from XVIIPentecost:
Year C, Track II, Proper 22
Habakkuk 1:1-4; 2:1-4
Psalm 37:1-10
2 Timothy 1:1-14
Luke 17:5-10
We hope you've been encouraged and edified by our work! Christ be with you!

Fr. Matt is the prospective vicar of All Souls Episcopal Church, a church plant in Horizon West, FL. All Souls is planning to begin their regular worship on Sunday 3 November, 2019 at 10:00am!
