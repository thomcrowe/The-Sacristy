On this third episode of the Sacristy, Fathers Matt and David prepare for the Thirteenth Sunday after Pentecost, September 8, 2019. You’ll have a chance to enjoy (or possibly endure) Fr. Matt’s dual obsession with Taco Bell and 2014’s Interstellar, explore the Church Calendar for the week, and hear about 10 books we love. 

As always, we'll close with our Sermon First Pass with the Sunday lessons from XIII Pentecost:

Year C, Track II\
Deuteronomy 30:15-20\
Psalm 1\
Philemon 1-21\
Luke 14:25-33

We hope you've been encouraged and edified by our work! Christ be with you!

Fr. Matt is the prospective vicar of All Souls Episcopal Church, a church plant in Horizon West, FL. All Souls is planning to begin their regular worship on Sunday 3 November, 2019!\
