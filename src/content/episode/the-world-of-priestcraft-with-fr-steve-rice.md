On this second episode of the new season of the Sacristy, Fathers Matt and David prepare for the Twentieth Sunday after Pentecost, October 18, 2020. Thatâ€™s also the feast of St. Luke the Physician, which is fun. Friend and fellow priest, Fr. Steve Rice, joins the discussion from Winston-Salem, NC! After a new segment called Pastoring Pop Songs (yes it is as awesome as it sounds), the guys will talk with Fr. Steve about the importance of priestcraft in the life of the Church. 

As always, we'll close with our Sermon First Pass with the Sunday lessons from XX Pentecost as well as St. Luke:

Year A, Track II, Proper 23:

Isaiah 25:1-9\
Psalm 23\
Philippians 4:1-9\
Matthew 22:1-4

St. Luke:\
Ecclesiasticus 38:1-15\
Psalm 114\
2 Timothy 4:5-15\
Luke 4:14-21

We hope you've been encouraged and edified by our work! Christ be with you!
