On the Lesser Feast Minisode, Fr. Matt and Fr. David try to keep the weekly discipline of the Sacristy’s Sermon First Pass. You’ll also hear some feedback and discover how odd Fr. David’s sense of humor truly is. Pray for Fr. Matt.

As always, we hope that you are encouraged and edified by our work! Join us next time as we welcome our first guest, Canon Justin Holcomb!
