On this second episode of the Sacristy, Fathers Matt and David look forward to the Eleventh Sunday after Pentecost, August 25, 2019. You'll get a chance to hear one of the wildest experiences we've encountered as priests in public, explore the Church Calendar for the week, and help us begin a conversation about obedience and obligation as truly faithful and healthy aspects of the Christian life. 

As always, we'll close with our Sermon First Pass with the Sunday lessons from XI Pentecost:

Year C, Track II\
Isaiah 58:9b-14\
Psalm 103:1-8;\
Hebrews 12:18-29;\
Luke 13:10-17

We hope you've been encouraged and edified by our work! Christ be with you!

Fr. Matt is the prospective vicar of All Souls Episcopal Church, a church plant in Horizon West, FL. All Souls is planning to begin their regular worship on Sunday 3 November, 2019!\
